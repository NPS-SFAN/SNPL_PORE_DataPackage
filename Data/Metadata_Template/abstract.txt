The Snowy plover monitoring survey keeps track of the breeding population and reproductive success on the beaches of Point Reyes National Seashore (PORE). A census of plovers across all survey sites on PORE is performed, where each observed plover's age, sex, and leg bands (if any) are recorded. Nests found within the survey sites are recorded and tracked across a period of 28 days to monitor each nest's activity, tracking the number of chicks and any chicks lost during that interval. Predator presence and their activity at the time of observation is also documented. This data package contains the result of these surveys from 1997 up to 2023, with data on observed plovers and their leg bands (if any), nesting activity, and predator presence/activity.
